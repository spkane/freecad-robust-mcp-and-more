# Installation

This guide covers installing the FreeCAD MCP Server and connecting it to your AI assistant.

---

## Requirements

- **FreeCAD** 0.21+ or 1.0+ (with Python 3.11)
- **Python 3.11** (must match FreeCAD's bundled Python version)
- An **MCP-compatible AI assistant** (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

---

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install the MCP server:

```bash
pip install freecad-robust-mcp
```

### Method 2: From Source (for Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spkane/freecad-robust-mcp-and-more.git
cd freecad-robust-mcp-and-more

# Install mise (if not already installed)
curl https://mise.run | sh

mise trust
mise install
just setup
```

### Method 3: Docker

Run the MCP server in a container:

```bash
# Pull from Docker Hub
docker pull spkane/freecad-robust-mcp

# Or build locally
docker build -t freecad-robust-mcp .
```

**Note:** The Docker container runs the MCP server only—it does not include FreeCAD itself. You must run FreeCAD with the MCP Bridge workbench on your host machine (or in a separate container) and configure the MCP server to connect via `xmlrpc` or `socket` mode.

---

## Installing the MCP Bridge Workbench

The MCP Bridge Workbench runs inside FreeCAD and provides the connection point for the MCP server.

### Via FreeCAD Addon Manager (Recommended)

1. Open FreeCAD
1. Go to **Tools > Addon Manager**
1. Search for "FreeCAD MCP and More" or "MCP Bridge"
1. Click **Install**
1. Restart FreeCAD

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/spkane/freecad-robust-mcp-and-more/releases)
1. Extract to your FreeCAD Mod directory:
   - **Linux:** `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/Mod/`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/Mod/`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\`
1. Restart FreeCAD

---

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

### Step 1: Start FreeCAD with the MCP Bridge

1. **Start FreeCAD** and select the **MCP Bridge** workbench from the workbench selector dropdown
1. **Click "Start MCP Bridge"** in the toolbar (or use the MCP Bridge menu)
1. Check the FreeCAD console for confirmation messages:

```text
MCP Bridge started!
  - XML-RPC: localhost:9875
  - Socket:  localhost:9876
```

### Step 2: Verify the MCP Server

Test that the MCP server command is available:

```bash
# With pip installation
freecad-mcp --help

# With source installation
uv run freecad-mcp --help
```

### Step 3: Test the Connection

With FreeCAD running and the bridge started, you can verify connectivity:

```bash
# Quick connectivity test using curl (XML-RPC)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9875 \
  -H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
  -d '<?xml version="1.0"?><methodCall><methodName>ping</methodName></methodCall>'
```

A successful response indicates the bridge is working correctly.
