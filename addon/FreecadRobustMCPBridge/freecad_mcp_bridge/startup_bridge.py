"""FreeCAD Robust MCP Bridge Startup Script.

SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
Copyright (c) 2025 Sean P. Kane (GitHub: spkane)

This script starts the MCP bridge in FreeCAD GUI mode. It checks if the bridge
is already running (e.g., from workbench auto-start) before starting a new
instance to avoid port conflicts.

CRITICAL: This script waits for FreeCAD.GuiUp to be True before starting the
bridge. If we start when GuiUp is False, the bridge uses a background thread
for queue processing, which causes crashes when executing Qt operations.

Usage:
    # Passed as argument to FreeCAD GUI on startup
    freecad /path/to/startup_bridge.py

    # Or on macOS:
    open -a FreeCAD.app --args /path/to/startup_bridge.py
