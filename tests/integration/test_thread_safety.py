"""Thread safety tests for FreeCAD Robust MCP Bridge.

These tests verify that code execution happens on the correct thread
depending on FreeCAD's mode (GUI vs headless).

CRITICAL: In GUI mode, code MUST execute on the main Qt thread.
Executing Qt operations from background threads causes crashes.
This was discovered when Init.py started the bridge before FreeCAD.GuiUp
was True, causing the bridge to use a background thread even in GUI mode.
