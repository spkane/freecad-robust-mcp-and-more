# Trivy Vulnerability Ignore File
# ================================
# This file tells trivy to skip specific CVEs during image scanning.
# Use this for vulnerabilities that:
#   - Have no fix available yet (check Alpine security tracker)
#   - Are false positives for our use case
#   - Are accepted risks with documented justification
#
# Format: One CVE ID per line, optionally with comment
# Docs: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/
#
# Before adding a CVE here:
#   1. Verify no fix is available: https://security.alpinelinux.org/
#   2. Document the reason and expected fix date if known
#   3. Set a reminder to revisit when fixes become available
#
# To check if fixes are now available, run:
#   just docker::scan

# We run `apk upgrade --no-cache` in the Dockerfile to get the latest patches,
# but some CVEs may not have fixes yet.

# NOTES

# - Review this file monthly to remove CVEs that now have fixes
# - The `apk upgrade` in Dockerfile should auto-fix most CVEs when rebuilding
